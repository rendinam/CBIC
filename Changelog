CBIC Library/Application Aggregate Changelog   
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
  Version numbers are <major>.<minor>.<patch>
    Minor versions change to signify an incompatibility in communication
     structure defintions between releases that must be addressed with
     updated (re-flashed) instrument software.
    Point releases are for changes less disruptive than that.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

v1.5.4   --  -2011    <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu
               == General Changes ==
- New instrument executable built and installed.  
  Version ID = 1106231257

                  == Bugfixes ==
- Corrected fencepost error in the rotate_block_bunch_pattern() function of
  the instrument program code that caused one less bunch than was correct
  to be reported as having wrapped in bunch patterns that wrap back to the
  beginning of the bunch pattern registers.

- Fixed error in instrument code causing invalid handshakes to be returned for
  every eighth turn-by-turn measurement in variable-gain modes only.  This
  was related to error flagging function in the instrument code.  The problem
  locations in the get_raw_data call chain have been excised, but a
  re-examination / refactoring of the error trapping and classification
  mechanisms is in order.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.5.3   -- 13-Jun-2011    <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu
                  == Bugfixes ==
- 4ns bunch-by-bunch current monitor command fixed to correctly honor all
  possible CESR polarity transitions by changing monitoring state accordingly.

               == Feature Additions ==
- Pre-publishing magnitude checking implemented for betatron phase 
  angles/amplitudes and button values for betatron phase command.
  If values fall outside acceptable range, an error is thrown and the values
  are not published to the CESR MPM.

- Pre-publishing button magnitude checking implemented for orbit command.
  If values fall outside acceptable range, an error is thrown and the values
  are not published to the CESR MPM.

- Diagnostic dump command added to main menu to allow for formatted dumping
  of all communication structure contents (except the large front-end data
  buffers, unless explicitly requested, for speed reasons) and all front-end
  registers to disk for perusal.  This is meant to be used in the event an
  instrument is found in an improper state.  The dump can be performed before
  the usual ameliorative power cycle to try and correlate internal state to
  the bad behavior.

- Added menu command "Enable FG Zero-Crossing Sample Point" to allow for
  shifting block delays to relocate the sample point of all active instruments
  from the peak of the waveform to close to the zero-amplitude crossing point
  for timing jitter studies.  Command is primitive in that it does not yet
  provide a way to shift the delays back to their original state.  A program
  restart is presently required to do this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.5.2   --  18-Apr-2011    <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu
               == Feature Additions ==
- Additional prompts added to the "apply gain mapping correction" command
  to allow for controlling how gain scale factors are applied to an
  an intermediate parameter file prior to installation.
   1) Multiply existing gain scale factors by those found in the gain mapping
      input file.
   2) Replace the existing gain scale factors with those found in the gain
      mapping input file.  This also prompts for species so as not to
      overwrite existing scale factors for the timing block not being updated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.5.1   --  17-Apr-2011    <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                  == Bugfixes ==
- Additional diagnostic output added for command dispatch and processing

- Timing setup names explicitly include a 'VAR_G' or 'FIX_G' component to
  remove ambiguity in requested timing setup gain regime

- Improved current monitor measurement termination mechanism.  No longer
  susceptible to conflicts when interrupting CBInet data transfers.

- Pedestal table composition bug resulting in inflated pedestal amplitudes
  for non-4ns-e+ timing setups fixed.

               == General Changes ==
- New instrument executable built and installed.  
  Version ID = 1102281008

- File input API documentation for developers is now available in the 
  CBPM-TSHARC/doc directory.

               == Feature Additions ==
- New menu command added to allow reconfiguration of instrument parameters
  by re-reading the instrument parameter file specified in the application
  config file and re-sending them down to selected instruments.  This allows
  manual adjustment or resetting of instrument parameters without restarting
  the application.

- Arbitrary (14ns) bunch betatron phase measurements are supported for all
  bunches up to bunch 75 via new turns offset accounting system evident in
  the master BPM parameter file.

- Substantial refinements and expansion of new version 3 raw data file format
  and developer APIs for C and Fortran.
   o The API supports retrieving data file by index alone via examination of
     CESR online and OFFLINE data areas as well as retrieval via full path
     name of a data file.

- Example programs provided for testing the C- and Fortran-Language file input
  APIs

- Operations support scripts added to revision control.
    start_BPM_server - For bringing up the standard BPM servers
    start_CURRMON    - For bringing up the 4ns bunch-by-bunch current monitor

- Stand-alone RAW data file merge utility provided for creating a single
  unified RAW data file out of separate files generated from a single 
  instrument by decoupled West and East BPM server instances.

- Data file down-conversion program provided to convert the canonical raw
  data file format (RD_V3) to the old (RD_V1) format so as to temporarily 
  maintain compatibilty with 3rd party tools that depend on the older format.

- Automatically-generated communication structure dumping functions now
  provided when communication data structure code and headers are generated.
  Will be part of expanded diagnostic capability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.5.0   --   10-Sep-2010    <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                  == Bugfixes ==
- Some minor user interface and informational output corrections for clarity.

               == General Changes ==
- New instrument executable built and installed.  
  Version ID = 1009081113

           == Performance Optimizations ==
- Betatron phase measurements now only calculate and report the angle
  calculation coefficients for the predetermined 1/2-turn wait state and
  turns offset value pair found during installation and configuration.  This
  greatly speeds up the measurement of betatron phase advance angles.

               == Feature Additions ==
- 4ns bunch-by-bunch current monitor behavior adjusted to print out to 
  the terminal the gain setting transitions as they are performed during
  the measurement loop.

- New data file format introduced along with file I/O routines for 3rd-party
  use.  
         The data file format "RDe-..." will still be generated alongside
  the new data file whenever a turn-by-turn or raw measurement is carried out.
  Eventually, this RDe format will be deprecated entirely.
  
- New file input routines for 3rd-party developer use are available for the 
  C language.
  See data file input API documentation for detailed usage notes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.4.7   --   24-Jul-2010    <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                  == Bugfixes ==
- Commands reqested in server mode now fall back to a sensible default for
  number of turns if the value provided via the CESR MPM control 
  (CBPM CONTROL) arrays is either unitialized or otherwise invalid.

               == General Changes ==
- General usability adjustments and terminal output clarifications.

           == Performance Optimizations ==
- Changed order of events for command processing in server mode.  In the event
  an instrument needs to be put through a recovery procedure, this will now
  happen after the command completion notice is sent to the requesting client
  to decrease the wait time for confirmed data delivery in the event a subset
  of instruments needs to be reinitialized due to failure.
  NOTE: In a multi-server setup, in the event of a recovery process being 
        initiated on one server, the other server will typically be in a
        receptive state for commands and will honor them, while the other
        server ignores them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.4.6   --   14-Jul-2010    <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                  == Bugfixes ==
- Improvements to reliability and recovery robustness and speed.  Eliminated 
  socket close operations to instruments that may not have sockets opened to
  them under certain circumstances to prevent socket close error messages.

- Improved descriptiveness of command sub-function failure error messages.

- Added missing error code processing that was causing the nonspecific 
  "plain old error" message when certain combinations of communication errors
  were encountered so that the specific error condition is now trapped and 
  handled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.4.5   --   2-Jul-2010    <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

               == General Changes ==
- Extended turn-by-turn data file format adjusted slightly to now include
  an explicit mention of the number of bunches in addition to the bunch
  pattern definition itself in the file header.

                  == Bugfixes ==
- Typo in instrument headers of data files "Numer of turns" is now
  "Number of turns".

- Fixed instrument selection by range indexing bug.

               == Feature Additions ==
- New, standardized commands for installing new electronic gain corrections 
  and applying gain mapping corrections to existing gain factor tables.

- Improved terminal printout in several locations for better timestamping
  in any log files created as part of operations running.

- Orbit measurements now publish to the new 'BPM ORB DATA' node with button
  values and calculated positions in addition to the old locations.

- Betatron phase measurements now publish to the new 'BPM PHA DATA' with 
  horizontal and vertical amplitudes and phases.

- A simple turn-by-turn data file reading routine is provided.  It allows
  one to read in all instruments, bunches, and turns worth of button and 
  position data from an 'RDe'-type data file into a caller-provided array
  of floats.
  See the header documentation of the file 
  CBPM-TSHARC/file_io/cbpm_read_tbt_data.c for complete usage information.

           == Performance Optimizations ==
- Forced flushing of terminal output in strategic spots to provide more rapid
  update of display when using standard output redirection for logging
  purposes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.4.4   --   15-Jun-2010    <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                  == Bugfixes ==
- Added additional fault checking to improve stability in orbit monitoring.

               == Feature Additions ==
- Two-tier mode handles intelligent management of instrument sets across
  multiple back-ends.

- Better single-point failure handling in command handshake check.  Will no 
  longer wait for multiple instruments to experience the full timeout period,
  performs a rapid check on remaining instruments after any one instrument 
  times out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.4.3   --   8-Jun-2010    <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                  == Bugfixes ==
- Fixed buggy error text display for XBUS communication structure transfer 
  operations.

- Instruments that fail a command execution because of poor timing integrity
  will be disabled at the end of an (otherwise successful) reset and 
  re-initialization recovery process to prevent repeated recovery requests
  for that instrument.

               == Feature Additions ==
- Turn-by-turn data requests honor the number of turns specified in the
  cbpm_request and consequently copied to the control mailbox arrays instead
  of the prior hardcoded 1024 turn limit.

           == Performance Optimizations ==
- Centralized management of CBInet socket communication to instruments.  This
  cuts down on the number of socket open and close events, speeding up 
  operation and aiding consistency and reliability.

- Commands now allow for a parallel post() function mode that greatly speeds
  up data delivery by transferring data from multiple instruments 
  simultaneously.  Usage notes are provided for this mode as some requirements
  for the construction of post() functions that shall take advantage of this
  mode must be followed for proper operation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.4.2   --  25-May-2010    <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                  ==  Bugfixes ==
- Communication problems during startup will result in an instrument being
  deactivated entirely instead of being placed into maintenance level 1,
  which would still cause it to receive command requests, often slowing
  down measurements needlessly.

- Recovery procedure from a communications problem or command handshake
  timeout during a command execution now only reactivates the instruments
  that were active at the time of the failure and not all instruments online
  as it did previously.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.4.1   -- 19-May-2010    <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                  ==  Bugfixes ==
- Averaged button data gets corrected appropriately now at the right stage 
  of events to make the quotients sensible as the output of a measurement
  whether or not jitter suppression is enabled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.4.0   -- 13-May-2010    <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                  ==  Bugfixes ==
- Betatron phase measurements now allow for full triggering with enable
  request.

               == Feature Additions ==
- A turns counter summary is provided for select commands.  At the moment,
  only processed data acquisitions show this table of active instruments
  and the value their internal turn counter register had at the moment the
  acquisition was started.

- Turn by turn data file instrument header has been expanded to include
  additional vital information about each measurement.  This is provided in
  a supplementary 'Raw Data - Extended' file _alongside_ the traditionally
  formatted RD-XXXXX.dat file and has a RDe-XXXXX.dat filename.  It will 
  eventually supercede the traditional format to become the standard
  turn-by-turn data file format.

- Now performs a turn counter synchronization on all powered instruments 
  whenever any instrument is power-cycled via the control application.

- Betatron phase command also provides simple averaged data output to the
  traditional orbit button data node in the CESR database.
  
           == Performance Optimizations ==
- Betatron phase command now allows two modes of operation:
  1) Compute phase tables mode - will construct coefficients for every 
    'phase race wait' and 'turns offset' parameter combination.
  2) Report phase only mode - this will skip the generation of the phase
     tables since the appropriate race wait and turns offset values will 
     already have been determined for the given location.  Much faster, as
     it minimizes the number of ADC buffer accesses and does not write
     anything to disk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.3.1   -- 5-May-2010    <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

               == Feature Additions ==
- More robust and rapid management of instrument communication status, power 
  supply, and processor state upon application startup.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.3.0   -- 24-Mar-2010    <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

               == General Changes ==
- First release after _major_ code refactoring/reorganization. Library
  hierarchy reworked to allow generalization to higher channel-count
  devices such as BSMs.

- Strict naming conventions applied to all instrumentation code.

                  ==  Bugfixes ==
- Various housekeeping changes, tweaks and the like, too numerous to mention.
  See the repository commit logs for a detailed account.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.2.17  -- 24-Mar-2010    <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                  ==  Bugfixes ==
- Disabled some incomplete code for orbit data block transfer preparation.

               == Feature Additions ==
- Species can now be specified in bunch pattern composition GUI for 14ns
  patterns.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.2.16  -- 5-Mar-2010    <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                  ==  Bugfixes ==
- Removed vestigial portion of mechanism responsible for de-asserting the
  data enable bit.  It was causing multiple instrument timeouts on a server
  that experiences an instrument communications failure in a multiple CBPM_II 
  server arrangement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.2.15  -- 3-Mar-2010    <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

               == General Changes ==
- Master parameter file broken out into a detector (location)-specific
  file and an instrument-specific file.

                  ==  Bugfixes ==
- Fixed never saving timing parameters regardless of prompt response at
  conclusion of time_in command.

               == Feature Additions ==
- New instrument allocation system.  Allows one to define a named scheme
  of allocations of instruments to a series of server instances.  Allows
  for the simple assignment of a particular allocation of instruments to
  a program instance via command-line argument.

           == Performance Optimizations ==
- Instrument-specific and detector-specific parameter file I/O has been
  optimized for much faster operation.  This results in a much faster
  startup time and saving of intermediate parameter files.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.2.14  --  17-Feb-2010   <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                  ==  Bugfixes ==
- Fixed input prompt processor being called too late in progression of 
  raw_data_prep.  Trigger request is not honored.

- Fixed assignment omission preventing proper bucket being chosen when
  performing a time scan on an electron bunch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.2.13  --  9-Feb-2010   <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                  ==  Bugfixes ==
- Command copy_timing_params now properly preserves timing setup state.

- Changing length of mastser platform command list no longer has the 
  potential to break availability of server-mode commands.

               == Feature Additions ==
- New user input prompting system.  Allows configurable default values and
  input validation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.2.12  --  22-Jan-2010   <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                  ==  Bugfixes ==
- Processed data via 3rd party request (CESRV, etc) now performs
  pedestal subtraction AND gain scaling of processed data by default.

- Instrument reset command now properly toggles the instrument's digital
  board reset pin, waits for boot, pushes complete configuration info to
  the instrument, and then sets the timing setup when invoked from the
  main menu OR from an automatic instrument recovery.

- Temporary addition of gain table installation command/tool.  Added to
  main menu for speed of implementation.  When time allows, will be
  broken out into a standalone tool.

- Processed data (orbit) corruption on measurements that cause a gain
  setting transition addressed.

               == Feature Additions ==
- First pass at continuous processed data mode added.  Similar to the 4ns
  current monitor mode, it commands a collection of instruments to 
  continuously acquire some number of turns of data, process it, and
  publish the results (button averages and X, Y positions) to the MPM 
  database.  The updated instrument (DSP) code build for this version must 
  be loaded to use this feature.

- Expanded support for maintenance mode flag and parameter in command-line
  options.  Maintenance mode 3 avoids communication with instruments to
  allow for low-level maintenance operations.  See command line help for
  details and usage.

- Power cycle and power cycle with reset and initialization commands
  added.  This allows targetted power cycling and initialization on an 
  individual instrument basis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.2.11  --  13-Jan-2010   <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                  ==  Bugfixes ==
- Changed polling frequency in DSP code of front-end cards for done bit 
  status to once per turn.  This was tested and appears to have elminated 
  the variation of command handshake return times and all instances of 
  previously unexplained handshake timeouts.

- Possibly related to above, took into account rollover of digital board
  turns counter register in low-level data acquisition routine.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.2.10  --  7-Jan-2010   <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                  ==  Bugfixes ==
- Two-tier operation bug that prevented proper socket and file pointer
  closing fixed.

               == Feature Additions ==
- Graphical bunch pattern composition tool added.  Allows for creation and
  saving of 4ns and 14ns bunch patterns in by category and pattern name.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.2.9  --  17-21-Dec-2009   <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                == General Changes ==
- Current monitor status output shows gain setting transitions when they
  occur.  

- Current monitor update speed increased to approximately 4Hz.

                  ==  Bugfixes ==
- Position calculation in turn-by-turn data files adjusted.

               == Feature Additions ==
- Command line option '-c' will automatically start the 4ns bunch-by-bunch
  current monitor upong application startup.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.2.8  --  14-Dec-2009   <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                  ==  Bugfixes ==
- Fixed file descriptor leak causing segfault after some number of
  pedestal table saves.

- Server mode instances now publish the data file type and index value
  into the CESR database CBPM control mailbox array.

- Turn-by-turn (raw) data acquisitions requested via server mode are now
  set to use the gate enable signal and the 60Hz trigger.

               == Feature Additions ==
- In managed mode, data enable triggering is now provided internally
  for turn-by-turn data acquisitions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.2.7  --  10-Dec-2009   <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                  ==  Bugfixes ==
- Pedestal acquisition now returns each instrument to the timing setup and
  gain setting it was in before the acquisition was requested.

- 4ns current monitor mode tested and brought into conformity with 1.2->1.2
  development branch transition.

- 4ns current monitor now publishes strictly positive values to the 'ELE/POS
  2NS MAMP' arrays so injection software is able to compute the total current
  correctly and publish to the species-specific current value locations.

- Fixed incorrect publishing location for data serial number (part of 
  injection system handshake)

- Fixed instrument location printout corruption in last stage of time-in
  sequence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.2.6  --  8-Dec-2009   <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                  ==  Bugfixes ==
- Reset and init procedure correctly handles restoring gain settings again.

           == Performance Optimizations ==
- Session-based file output implemented and tested.  Drastically improves
  the time it takes to save pedestal tables to disk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.2.5  --  7-Dec-2009   <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

               == Feature Additions ==
- Time scan operations now produce an on-screen summary of channel delay
  changes produced.  Channel-to-channel or absolute channel delay
  corrections greater than a certain magnitude are visually flagged.
  
- The channel trimming operation via the time_scan command is now
  available in server mode to 3rd party applications.

- Raw (turn-by-turn) data acquisitions hardcoded at 1024 turns are now
  available in server mode to 3rd party applications.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.2.4  --  1-Dec-2009   <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                  ==  Bugfixes ==
- Fixed bug in time_in sequence that prevented 14ns electron timings from
  being properly acquired.
- Fixed bug in orbit data publishing that wrote electron data to the wrong
  block of the DDATA database array.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.2.3  --  30-Nov-2009   <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                  ==  Bugfixes ==
- Expanded consistency enforcement between timing setup and gain regime
  when starting up in an arbitrary timing setup.  A case was overlooked
  with the previous fix.

- Inability to CTRL-C out of server mode when an instrument encoutered
  an error during startup communications checks fixed.

- DSP code bugfix in get_betatron_phase_A button sum calculation was
  not using corrected ADC values.  Now uses corrected values in button
  sum used in accumulator entry product.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.2.2  --  25-Nov-2009   <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                  ==  Bugfixes ==
- Keeps proper consistency between timing setup and gain regime
  (fixed vs. variable) when starting up in an arbitrary timing setup.

               == Feature Additions ==
- Added new DUMP RAW DATA command.  This will write to disk the collection
  of turn-by-turn data used for the most recently executed command.

v1.2.1  --  21-Nov-2009   <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

               == General Changes ==

                  ==  Bugfixes ==
- Fixed processed (averaged) data routine in DSP code that took the
  absolute value of all data coming from the front ends instead of the
  intended temporary comparison value.

           == Performance Optimizations ==
- Pedestal acquisition now acquires values for all channels, all supported
  timing setups, and all gain ranges as a single on-instrument operation.
  Tables are read back as a single unit.

               == Feature Additions ==
- Added first pass at support of two-tier operation.
  Application can be placed in 'manager' mode or 'back-end' mode.
  
  The manager mode allows for the spawning and control of an arbitrary
  number of parallel back-end instances on separate host machines. Each
  back-end instance is then responsible (as in the present unmanaged 
  operation mode) for the direct control and read-back of some number of
  instruments.
  
  The back-end mode is a lower level concept and is meant to be initiated 
  by a manager mode instance, though for testing purposes it can be 
  manually invoked as well.

  Single data file creation for arbitrary file-generating commands is
  supported and allows for a single data file to be produced containing 
  the output of any number of back-end processes, preserving a 
  'one measurement, one data file' idea regardless of how the instrument
  subsets are distributed.
  
  Support for this feature is operational, but presently serves as a
  proof-of-concept and will be made more user friendly in a future 
  release.

  Detailed usage notes will follow further development.

v1.2.0  --  14-Oct-2009?   <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

               == General Changes ==
- Merging of 1.1.2 operations branch and the reorganized and efficiency-
  optimized design update concerning timing and gain parameters, their 
  storage, transfer, and use.

                  ==  Bugfixes ==
- Now server mode can be terminated to enter interactive mode for the
  purpose of instrument subset investigations and placed back into server 
  mode with no ill effects such as servers ignoring 3rd party command
  requests as sometimes happened prior to this fix.

           == Performance Optimizations ==
- Command handshake checking now occurs far more rapidly
- Customization option for max number of handshake tries added
- Partitioned supplementary data read back as a result of a processed
  data (orbit) measurement by debug verbosity to only transfer the 
  minimum essential data for each measurement unless extra is explicitly
  requested.

               == Feature Additions ==
- User convenience feature added: Ability to store named bunch patterns
  for quick retrieval.  See application configuration file template 
  (cbic.conf) for location of bunch pattern definition file.  
  Documentation on use of stored bunch patterns will live in that file
  and in master documentation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.1.2  --  12-Oct-2009  <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

                  ==  Bugfixes ==
- Bugfix to ensure recovery mode flag is reset for all instruments after 
  a command or sequence is processed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.1.1  --  6-Oct-2009  <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

             == General Changes/Additions ==
- Changed time scan bunch index entry to be less ambiguous for 14ns timing
  setups.  Always prompts for an index in the range 1-183 for those modes,
  but transparently takes the species into account for activating bunch bits
  on the appropriate timing block.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
v1.1.0  --  2-Oct-2009  <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

             == General Changes/Additions ==
- Runtime error classification expanded.  Each command execution now provides 
  a command status summary of each instrument that was party to the command 
  request.
- A recovery sequence will be run for all instruments that encounter errors
  above a criticality threshold during command dispatching, execution, or 
  post-processing.
  The recovery sequence will attempt a low-level XBUS-delivered hardware reset
  of each problem instrument's CPU as well as its ethernet communications 
  processor.
  After the boot period has elapsed, the recovery sequence will attempt to 
  reinitialize the timing and gain operational parameters to their pre-fault
  state.  If an additional error is encountered during the recovery process,
  the instrument will remain online, but will be deactivated for all further 
  command requests.
  
  
        == Command-line Option Changes/Additions ==
- '-h' : Help text expanded / updated.  See '-h' output for details on the
         options below.
- '-d' : Multi-level debug verbosity settings implemented
- '-v' : Updated, displays application and support component version info.
- '-s' : Added for starting up application and automatically entering BPM 
         server mode once instruments are online.
- '-f' <filename> : Added for allowing custom application config file usage.


        == Operational Support Changes/Additions ==
- A single install location is used for holding the CBIC appliction executable
       /a/lnx180c/nfs/cesr/mnt/linux_bin/cbic
  This is a symbolic link to the version-named copy of the executable.
  As new versions are installed, the link will be adjusted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.0.0  --  4-Sep-2009  <mcr> -- mcr38@cornell.edu

- First version installed for operations
